Urban bike-sharing systems such as Citi Bike in New York City generate millions of trip records each year, offering valuable insight into mobility and congestion patterns. 
This project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model to forecast hourly congestion levels defined as the number of rides ending at a specific station and a certain hour of the day across major Citi Bike locations 
such as Hoboken Terminal, Burchard, River Street, etc. 
Using historical trip data from 2019-2023, we will compare classical time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet) and modern deep learning approaches (Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM-RNN). 
The resulting forecasts can guide adaptive bike redistribution and improve commuter experience. Preliminary goals include achieving high predictive accuracy (low RMSE, high $R^2$) and interpretable spatio-temporal insights for smart urban mobility management.
